If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs; 
This will return the values for the top 100 songs
    energy      valence        danceability
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
These are the average values from the top 100 songs
From the six auras i would pick Blue and Orange.
Because of the low valence, our listener likes to get in touch with his feelings
However he still wants to dance to them and be energetic

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. 
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
These are only some of the charactistics of the top 100 songs

These are the results for the averages for all columns

| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) | AVG(loudness) | AVG(speechiness) | AVG(tempo) | AVG(duration_ms) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+---------------+------------------+------------+------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           | -5.67764      | 0.115569         | 119.90418  | 205206.78        |

Here we can see that our user likes danceable tracks, not so much talking with a moderate tempo of 119 bpm
Most likely a steady and heavy drum beat that is not too fast
Songs tend to be on the sadder side but still energetic
I would still go with Orange due to the short song length and high danceability
Perhaps I would lean more with purple than blue as the songs are less in the sad realm
and more into songs that move us in everyday life and help us persist.
