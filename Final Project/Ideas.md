I can create a virtual guitar that can be played on the web app
using t3 stack with app router
i can record all notes by myself
we can limit it to the first 12 frets but expand it later
also include some images of scales to help learn them
perhaps somehow include the 12 bar blues with a timeout and a changing chord
