# CS50

## CS50 Projects

After jumping relatively quickly into the world of modern web development frameworks, using all the fanciest tools
and everything is abstracted to the point where each complex feature takes a few lines of code, I have decided to take a step back.

This means that I am going back to the basics by learning all about C and what a low-level language looks like.
I started with Python and did much of the same projects that are included in the problem sets in this Course, however with a much
different implemtion.

## Repository

This is my collection of all the solutions for the practice problems, labs and problem sets for the C lessons in CS50.
