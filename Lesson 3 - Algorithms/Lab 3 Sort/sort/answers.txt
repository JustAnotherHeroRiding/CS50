sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: After running the sort 3 binary on the sorted 50000 text file, it had the fastest speed.
A bubble sort will algorithm will exit if no swamps are made after one loop, which it seems to have happened here.


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Fastest on sorting random 50000

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Slowest on random 50000, while the time complexity is the same as bubble sort, it is a little slower still
